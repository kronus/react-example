After Delberts passing, I received all kinds of inspiration to write all of these songs. However, I did not share them with anyone until it was looking more and more that the time for my best friend was coming to its course. The following songs: Avalanches, Friends and To the One were inspired to me a few months before turning the age of twelve. I would like to thank Carol, for pushing me to finally record these songs.It was 1975, when Delbert left his body. Thanks for being kind to me, when everyone else was so cruel.I would relish seeing you each morning while we would be hall patrol monitors.I still miss that smiling face of yours.Even when some kids would use the 'N' word directed at you.You showed me,\tthat what you think of yourself is more important than what others think of you.And everyone knows that I love myself. The big question to me is, why doesnt everyone else. I love all of my friends and family. Yeah, basically anyone who loves me. After a suggestion from a friend (Jak Delany), I have re-recorded and remixed. Now you can hear everything more clearly",

Of course, one could argue that every great guitarist does that, but Hendrix was the first.\n\nThis is the first time that I am using the Fishman Triple Play via Orange Tree Sample Statosphere, ironically enough their preset is called \"Bold Love.\" There is a slight delay that I had to account for and not bad for a first take.\n\nAccording to the sheet music that I have, this is in the key of G major. The intro is played in G major\n\nVerse:\nFsus2 (viisus2), Am (ii), Em7 (vi7)\n\nThe lead is played entirely over a G major chord\n\nEach verse begins with the intro played in G major.\n\nMusic historians should take note that before Hendrix, everything used to follow a blues progression, either in the key of E or A, but Hendrix busts out of that cage and gives us a progression that was never heard in popular music, until that he did it.\n\nBeethoven is known for realizing the power of resolving a tone, from seventh to tonic, second to tonic or Aeolian to tonic. Notice how Hendrix uses all three and resolves to tonic with the play of the intro in between the progressions. Along with the lyrics, to keep the listener unresolved until the chorus, where he frees them with the words of wisdom \"Castles made of sand...\"",

To elaborate more, Beethoven was always trying to do tension followed by resolve\n\nAs usual, I record all mistakes or wrongs and this is from the second take, not bad.

I am blessed to have been born at a time where I could experience such songs in real time as they happened.\n\nThis is the most popular song on that album and it allowed for an opportunity to introduce this awesome band to a larger audience. This song has five guitar tracks and I am only playing one of the lead tracks.\n\nIf you listen to my old recording of this cover (http://kronusproductions.com/uploads/playMp3.php?mPlaySong=Closer-to-the-heart.mp3) then you can hear that I use all of my fingers on the acoustic guitar, without the use of a pic. As a result, I had to record a separate track for the rhythm and lead, which I did not want to do this time around.\n\nAccording to the sheet music that I have, this is in the key of A major.\n\nYou can see the pattern of notes played from the tab/midi in the intro which finishes the following progression:\nG6 (vii6), D (IV), Fmaj7 (vib7), Asus2 (Isus2), Asus4 (Isus4), A (I), Asus2 (Isus2), Asus4 (Isus4), A (I)\n\nVerse:\nA (I), G (vii), D (IV), G (vii), A (I)\nA (I), G (vii), D (IV), A (I), G (vii), D (IV), A (I), G (vii)\n\nThe lead is played over the verse progression and ends with the intro, minus the aforementioned progression.\n\nOther than the intro pattern of notes, I would have to say that this is one of their more simple songs to play. Ironic that I am only recording the lead portion, but as I stated above, there are five guitar parts and the VSTs, along with the tab, give you clear picture of how this can be played.",

I tried to combine both Stevie Ray Vaughn and Hendrix version to make my own I guess. \n\nAccording to the sheet music that I have, this is played in the key of E major and it follows a standard blues progression\n\nE7 (I7), A7 (IV7), E7 (I7), A7 (IV7), E7 (I7), B7 (V7), A7 (IV7), Em7 (i7)\n\nThere is a chromatic progression that acts as an intro to the lead and it is also used to end the song\n\nF#5 (ii5), G5 (iii5), G#5 (III5), A5 (IV5), A#5 (IV#5) pause B5 (V5), B#5 (V#5), C#5 (vi5), D5 (vii5), D#5 (VII5)\n\nIf you feel like you are listening to Hendrix, when you listen to Vaughan, then it is because they do the same things, like flowing in and out of major and minor pentatonic scales, with a dash of blues pentatonic added for flavor.\n\nOne of the keys to sounding like either of them, is that they play the guitar with heavy hand that is flexible. Beat the guitar up, like you are in a fight and then play with it, like it's a child that you are tickling.\n\nThis is my first time to record using the Casio MG-510, while I am not using the midi portion of the guitar, it does have a natural Strat sound.\n\nAs usual, I record my mistakes and this was the fifth take. I keep getting lost in the melodic section of the first lead. It's pretty straight forward and I do not understand why, but on the fifth take, I gave into the Universe, that it wants it this way.",

Otherwise, I could get the feedback effect needed for some of the whammy bar action that is need to do this song justice\n\nIt took five takes, but much of that had to do with technical issues, like only having the left side of the channel plugged. Yes, really. Otherwise, it went pretty smooth. Some of the timing in the vocals was off, but I did not want to record another take.\n\nAccording to the sheet music that I have, this song is played in the key of A major.\n\nIntro:\nA (I), E (V), F# (vi)\n\nVerse:\nA (I), E (V), F# (vi)\n\nChorus:\nC#5 (iii5), D5 (IV5), C#5 (iii5), D5 (IV5), E (V5)\n\nThe lead is played over the following progression:\nA (I), E (V), A (I), F# (vi), A (I), F# (vi), A (I), B (ii), C# (iii), D (IV), C# (iii)\n\nThe second lead changes the progression by playing the last part first:\nA (I), B (ii), C# (iii), D (IV), C# (iii), A (I), E (V), A (I), F# (vi), A (I), F# (vi)\n\nAs usual, I record all my mistakes, some in the first lead and in the outro.",

She could always put a smile on my face, as I with her. We had a completely plutonic relationship with a lot of sexual innuendoes.\n\nAnytime I hear this song or \"The boys of summer\" by Don Henley, ironic that he sings both of them, I think of her and it puts a melancholy smile on my face. \n\nAccording to the sheet music that I have, this is played in the key of G major\n\nIntro and Outro:\nG6 (I6), C6 (IV6), G6 (I6) the sheet music says G7, but I see it as a G6\n\nVerse:\nG (I), G7sus2 (I7 sus2), C (IV), Cm6 (iv6), G (I), Em7 (vi7), A7 (ii7), D7 (V7) repeat and end with D7/F# (V7/VII) I only play a D7\n\nChorus:\nEm7 (vi7), Bm7 (iii7), C (IV), G (I), D7/F# (V7/VII) I just play a D7\nEm7 (vi7), Em (vi), C (IV), G, D/F# (V/VII) I only play a D7 \nrepeat and I end with A7 (ii7), D7 (V7)\n\nI know my vocals do not do this song justice, but I am getting much better and I plan to get a lot better as time rolls along. That is the one thing that I regret in life, is not putting in as much time for vocals, as I have for all the other instruments, but I thought I would find a singer by now.\n\nAs usual all mistakes are recorded, with no overdubs or punch ins",

This is when people would tell me after a performance, \"if you could sing, then you would be bigger than Elvis\"\n\nI took it as a complement, because I never worked on the one instrument, that probably could have made a big difference. I had always assumed that I would meet a singer and they would handle their portion of the song.\n\nAll of this electronic instruments was supposed to be temporary back in '91. I figured, that at some point, other musicians would see me play and the ideas that I had for other instruments, which would be followed by, \"hey I like your jams, would you be interested in playing together some time\"\n\nAnd while I have been offered a few handful of times to collaborate, either some drama would ensue or the musician could not perform what my computer could do, anytime that I requested and as often as I requested.\n\nKind of difficult to acquire such skill and discipline when you are not being paid. Never the less, the result was for me to have been taught all these areas of music that I probably would have never touched, had I been in a band that was successful early.\n\nI am following basic Beethoven and this is in the key of A major.\n\nIntro & Verse:\n\nA (I)\n\nChorus:\nA (I), E (V), D (IV) repeat twice\n\nThe lead is played over the verse and chorus progressions.\n\nPretty straight forward and, believe it or not, this is what most songs in the 50s and 60s where based on this progression. The difference between what I am doing and what they were doing, is that, they were playing to a Pentecostal back beat, whereas, I am reversing the beat of a Waltz, which is the same thing that ZZ Top, AC/DC, The Beatles (early 60s) etc... used to do.\n\nAs usual all mistakes are recorded",

At the time, 7 11 used to be heavily involved in the fight for Jerry's kids (muscular dystrophy) and, back then, Jerry would have this telethon that would raise money for the cause. My boss asked me to write a song and she would get on the show to sing it. I wrote the song that day and she called in a favor. That night was my first night working the graveyard shift and I was so excited that I would not have been able to sleep, had I not been working. The night was the night that I was robbed at gun point. More specifically, the barrel of the gun was at the temple of my forehead. The group of kids had asked me why there was no relish at the hot dog area. I knew that I had filled all the bowls and I knew no one had purchased any hot dogs that night for it to be gone. I walked back there and, sure enough, all the relish was gone. I bent down to get some more from underneath the counter, when the gun was put to the temple of my forehead (right side, in case you were wondering)\n\nThe criminals got away with a whopping $19 and change. Yeah, my life was worth a little under twenty dollars and that is what I thought to myself. I cried for almost a good two hours, when a security guard came in and asked what was the matter. I told him about the burglary and filing the police report and how my life was worth under twenty dollars. He gave me a card and eventually his recommendation gave me a job working for Houston Light & Power, which turned about to be a great job, because I started studying music theory working the grave yard shift in an almost completely empty building. It worked out, but by quitting the 7 11 job, I couldn't be on the telethon. Se la vie\n\nThis song is played in the key of C major.\n\nChorus:\nE (iii), D (ii)\n\nVerse:\nE (iii), D (ii), C (I), D (ii)\n\nBridge:\nE (iii), F# (IV#)\n\nThe lead is played over the chorus, verse and bridge progressions\n\nIt took me four takes because I couldn't click the distortion on time when the third verse starts. Otherwise, each take was perfect.",

Believe it or not, it was actually part of his chores that his parents set for him to do.\n\nWhile this was long before the Deguello album, which was released in 1979 and I would go to that tour in 1980.

Most people do not notice, because they are fixated on Billy Gibbons' awesome guitar, but this is a tough one. Normally I can get the drums and bass to be more in-synch than this, but after a while, you just have to let it go and hope that someone can pick up where you left off and you guys know that the midi is downloadable on my site. So if you can do better, by all means, have at it. One take for the guitar and vocals.\n\nI played the first section with no pick because I can play lighter sounding songs more clean without a pick. For the second part or fool redux, I used a pick. The second part was a midi file that I downloaded long ago, hoping that it would have the bass and drums like the original, but I loved what they did so much, that I had to tack it on to the original version for complete symmetry to my journey in trying to learn how to play this one.

Of course, later that year both John Bonham & John Lennon past away. With that said, this was also the year that I would attend my first concert. I had opportunities to go to previous Rush concerts in the seventies, but as a child only working part time, I could not afford the whopping $17.50 price. My how times have changed. I still cannot believe that I complained about that price.\n\nWhat can I say, it was literally half of my weekly paycheck working part time at the gas station. Nevertheless, I was not going to miss another tour and I saved up for a ticket and it was up to $25, which I held my tongue and took it like a man. I would love it if concert tickets were that price today.\n\nI got into every song on this album, except their most popular song, which played on the radio all the time - Entre Nous. It's a good song, but I just didn't get into that much. I personally love Natural Science the most and, living in Houston TX at the time, Freewill was not a song that was well received, except by die hard Rush fans, such as myself.\n\nAccording to the sheet music that I have, this is in the key of D major.\n\nThere are a series of notes and double stops that are played in the intro, I will break down the double stops (chords):\nF (iii), G (IV), C (vii), G (IV), F (iii)\nF (iii), G (IV), F (iii), C (vii), G9 (IV9)\n\nVerse is a series of notes that match the melody:\nF F C B A G, F F C E D C D E, F F C B A G, F F C E D B C G\n\nBridge or Pre-chorus:\nBm711 (vi7add11), Bb711 (vib711), Fsus2 (iii sus2), C (vii) I play an Fsus2 except with the E on the b string instead of the F, Bm711 (vi7add11), Bb711 (vib711), D to Dsus4 (I to I sus4)\n\nChorus - I simplify this section by playing:\nD (I), C# (VII), A (V), B (vi), E (ii), F# (iii), A (V)\nD (I), C# (VII), B (vi), A (V), G (IV), F# (iii), A (V) - I messed up every time during this recording\n\nInterlude is a series of notes. The lead is played over a solo bass, which could be viewed as the key of F major:\nF (I), Bb (IV), Eb (vii), Dm (vi)\n\nThis took me three takes on the guitar and two on the vocals, but as usual, I record all my mistakes.

		"description": "This is an original song that was written in three different decades. The first section was written in the late 70s. The second section (music) in the 90s and the lyrics in 2011.\n\nThis is being recorded a day after attending services for my good friend, Buddy Smith, rest in peace brother. Back in '87, he told me that I should pursue my music dream and go to California, which I did. I often wonder how my life would have gone, had he not believed in me so much. While I meet a lot ARs in Cali ('87-'88), I was stubborn and it kept me from signing a deal. I would return to Texas after spending most of '88 in NYC and continued to understand music theory, instead of just finding things while improvising. This one is dedicated to Buddy, I will always cherish all the good times that we had. You are a one of kind and thank you for your support.\n\nI can remember playing at Willies Pub (Rice University) in '86 and there were two people in the bar besides my bass player and myself (one of those two people was the bartender). During the third song of the set, I was jamming my ass off and I was so angry that no one was there to enjoy it or witness it. When I finished playing, there were all these applause and cheering. I looked up and Buddy had brought about twelve to fifteen people with him and he was leading the cheers with whistles and all. A true friend.\n\nThis song is combining three styles of music - Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn and the Beatles.\n\nThe first section is played in the key of C major and the second section is played in the key of E major.\n\nIntro:\nF(IV), G (V), A (vi) - repeat\nA (vi), D (ii), E (iii) - repeat 4 times\n\nVerse:\nC7 (I7), E7 (III7), Am (vi), F7 (IV7), C7 (I7), E7(III7) - it should be Em7, but I was a kid when I wrote this part\n\nChorus:\nA (VI), G (V), F (IV), G (V), A (VI) - it should be Am\n\nSecond part of the song is basically a twelve bar blues section with three interludes, just like the Beatles \"Yer Blues\" and so many other classic blues songs.\n\nVerse:\nA7 (IV7), E7 (I7) \n\nChorus:\nG (iii), B (V)\n\nBridge:\nE(I), A (IV), B(V)\n\nInterlude:\nB(V), E (I)\n\nThe lead is played over the twelve bar blues progression and I combine Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn licks in an E major pentatonic scale.\n\nSome timing issues in the beginning, not bad for two takes on guitar. Two takes for vocals with seven punch ins (timing) and a crackling noise that just comes from nowhere. I suspect that there is some kind of a spike in power and my power strip is supposed to handle this, but I cannot afford to spend any more on this project - oh well.\n \nRecorded all mistakes as usual and I hope you enjoy",

While other songs from the album, such as Spirit of the Radio, Freewill, etc..., are more famous, this song is not only my favorite on the album, but my favorite Rush song ever.\n\nI have an anthology Rush book, which means that some of the things that I do may not be according to the original sheet music, but according to the anthology, this song is played in the key of D major to E major in the intro, followed by changing to G major, then changing to A major \n\nWith that said, I have no music theory section for this song, but you can see the chords and notes that I play with the tabs. I play the notes in the first four verses a whole step up to match the midi file that I downloaded so long ago.\n\nTen takes for the guitar track (one technical issue after another) and one take for the vocals. I had to restart Cubase several times to make the animations of the instruments\n\nAll mistakes were recorded.",

Believe it or not, an Egyptian guy living in Torance, turned me on to them, when he let me hear his favorite songs\n\nI do not have the sheet music, but if I had to guess, then I would say that this song is played in the key of C major. There are four guitar tracks and I try to combine all of them. I turn down the volume of my guitar track during the verse because it is too distorted. Also, this song really kicked my computers ass with the four guitar tracks and, as a result, I had to do a lot of video editing to match the drums - still did not match up, but until I have a more powerful computer, other than a mac mini, this is the best that I could do with what I have.\n\nIntro & Chorus:\nA (vi), F (IV), G (V)\n\nVerse:\nAm (vi), F (IV) - repeat three times and end on C (I)\n\nOne take for the guitar track and one take on vocals \n\nAll mistakes were recorded.",

I often credit Dilbert with these songs, because they seemed to come out of nowhere, once again, after his passing.\n\nI was twelve years old at the time, and with that said, the music theory was not taken into account. As a result, there are some things that do not make sense, because it was based on what sounds good to me, as opposed to what is musically correct.\n\nLet's say it is in the key of E minor\n\nIntro:\nG (iii), F (iib), D (vii), Am (IV), Em (i) - looking back, I should have used F# instead of F, but it is probably because I had an aversion to playing sharps or flats. Had the black keys been the same height, then at twelve years old, I might not have tried to avoid them\n\nVerse:\nG (iii), B (V)\n\nI tried to explain how this song would be with all the instruments that I had in mind, but even my closest friends and family could not see it. Especially, since I was playing everything on an acoustic guitar, with the explanation of, \"And the strings would do this... and the drums would do this here...\" \n\nOne take on the guitar and vocal's track.\n\nAll mistakes were recorded.",

I called in on the line that it was a smash.\n\nGnR would later put out the album \"Appetite for Destruction\" which I fell in love with and I still say that the drumming is what made these songs special.

I changed the effects and instruments from the original midi file that I downloaded from somewhere long ago, when no one but myself and handful of people cared about midi or could see it's potential. As far as performance goes, my vocals and I played the guitar at the end, which are full of mistakes ☺",

Also, this is the first actual song using VST back in 2014.\n\nFirst lick, Stevie Vai. Of course in another key.\n\nSecond portion is Judas Priest, Scorpions and David Gilmore. \n\nThird portion is Alex Lifeson and ending with two pentatonic scales (G tonal) and (A minor tonal) over F Maj and C Maj, respectively.\n\nThe opening bass lick is arpeggiation of F/E, G/D, Dm/C, Dm/F, C/G, Am, F.\n\nThe horns are F chords.\n\nThe entire song is a vamp until you are ready style of progression in the key of F major. During the second solo a switch to A minor, along with the last portion of the song.\n\nTwo takes on the vocal's track and seven takes on the guitar track - several quick stops - start again.\n\nLyrics are spoken:\nI was with a stripper in a motel room in burbank. A little to expensive for a hole in the \nwall, if you ask me. I had her in k9, while pulling her hair and she said\n\nShe told me that she wanted to get into porn and I told her that I knew some of those guys\nand they would choke, beat and treat her like dirt and she said\n\nLittle girl turned into a super star with guys all around the world chokin the chicken to \nher every little word. She didn't have to take off a stitch of clothing to rock your world\n\nWatching her was a bonus\n\nI requested permission to use the girl's voice and promised to give her credit. She left the adult entertainment industry a few decades ago and wanted not to be named. At the same time, she also did not say that I could not use the recording.",

I hope she becomes better or at least goes quietly and peacefully into the night. I was watching a documentary on the great Stevie Wonder and this is an attempt to bring back that great sound of the 70s, post Motown sound. We were so blessed to have all those artist from Motown pick it up another notch in the 70s and 80s. It's incredible to think that in my life, I have seen Elvis, the Beatles, Hendrix, Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Rush, all the artist from Motown and Stevie Wonder, plus Michael Jackson - come on! What has come after the 80s, nothing! Maybe my stuff, but I am not famous. I have stopped using the twenty year old Alesis board a few songs back and the vocals have been going straight through the Profire 2626, can you hear the difference? I can actually hear my voice next to the instruments better than ever before. Still wish that I could be doing this in a real studio, with a real engineer.",

		"description": "\"For You Blue\" is a song by the Beatles. Written by George Harrison, it was the B-side to \"The Long and Winding Road\" (in the US) and the eleventh track on the Beatles' final LP release, Let It Be. \"For You Blue\" was listed with \"The Long and Winding Road\" as a double-sided hit when the single reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1970. This song, along with the other songs on the Let it Be album were the last songs that the four members of the Beatles recorded together. While the Let it Be album was the last album released, the Abbey Road album was the last to be recorded and the group used many other musicians to complete each of the songs for the Abbey Road. Billy Preston was invited to play on several songs for the Let it Be sessions. However, this was not one of those songs. Once more, making this one of the few last songs in which all four members of the Beatles played together. This is my first use of Orange Tree Samples' VSTs. In this case, I am using the Slide Lap Steel engine. NI's (Kontakt 5) The Gentlemen VST for piano, along with my fav for the bass - the Scarbee Rickenbacker Bass. Ample Sound's AGML for the acoustic guitar VST. If you hear a twelve string, then you would be correct. I doubled the track and raised the second by an octave, which is what a twelve string actually does. As usual, EZ drummer (DFH). This song also marks the first use of both compressors and limiters, which has allowed me to export the song at zero dbs. While I am able to do so with orchestral pieces, this is the first pop/blues tune, that I have been able to do. This is also my first vocal track to not use reverb from any type of physical device - all virtual - Reverence out of the box from Cubase 7.",

If you listen to the end of the song, then you will hear brushes on drums.\n\nBelieve it or not, but the Bee Gees inspired the synth track. Of course, it is in a different key, the tempo changes and the length of notes are also different\n\nThe song is played in the key of C major. Both parts of the song are played over I\n\nVerse:\nI IV I V I vi\n\nFor the jazz brush drumset portion, I sprinkle in chords where the tonic note is not played. Instead, I play a suspended ii note, whether that be for I, IV or V chords\n\nOne take for the guitar track and three takes for the vocals. I programmed all other parts.\n\nLyrics:\nVerse 1:\nCrisis is not the time to abandon one's principles\nconflict is over if one desires it\nwhen two start to fight\nfind what is better, about staying together\nThere maybe a need to win\nw/ a dash of behavioral instinct\nIntellect along side of compassion\ncan overcome the mask of anger\nJust remember, territory is for the inferior",
